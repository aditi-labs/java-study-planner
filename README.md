## Study Planner App Project Requirements

### Project Overview
#### 1.1 Problem Statement

Students often juggle multiple classes, assignments, projects, exams, and personal tasks. Its easy to forget deadlines, underestimate how long tasks will take, or leave everything to the last minute. Many tools exist, but they can be too complex or not tailored to how a CS student thinks and works.

1.2 Goal


Build a Study Planner application in Java that helps a student:

Organize tasks by course/subject

Track deadlines and priorities

Estimate and reflect on study time

Get a clear, simple view of what to work on next

The first version will be console-based, with possible future extension to a GUI (JavaFX).
