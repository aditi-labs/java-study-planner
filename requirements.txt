 Study Planner  Project Requirements Document
1. Project Overview
1.1 Problem Statement

Students often juggle multiple classes, assignments, projects, exams, and personal tasks. Its easy to forget deadlines, underestimate how long tasks will take, or leave everything to the last minute. Many tools exist, but they can be too complex or not tailored to how a CS student thinks and works.

1.2 Goal

Build a Study Planner application in Java that helps a student:

Organize tasks by course/subject

Track deadlines and priorities

Estimate and reflect on study time

Get a clear, simple view of what to work on next

The first version will be console-based, with possible future extension to a GUI (JavaFX).

2. Target User & Usage Context
2.1 Primary User

A university student (like her) with multiple courses per quarter.

Has basic comfort with the command line and running Java programs.

2.2 Usage Context

Used daily or several times a week.

Run on personal laptop.

Data stored locally (no cloud requirement for v1).

3. Scope
3.1 In Scope (for the first 13 months)

Managing subjects/courses

Managing tasks/assignments

Viewing tasks through basic reports (e.g., by due date or subject)

Saving and loading data from local files

Simple, menu-driven console UI

3.2 Out of Scope (for now)

Multi-user support

Sync across devices

Notification/reminder integration

Calendar integrations (Google Calendar, etc.)

Mobile app

These can be considered future enhancements.

4. Core Concepts & Definitions

Subject
A course or topic (e.g., CS 143, Math 124, English 131).

Task
A unit of work associated with a Subject (e.g., HW 3, Midterm Study, Project Draft).

Task Type (examples)

Homework

Quiz

Exam

Project

Reading

Priority Level

LOW

MEDIUM

HIGH

Status

Not started

In progress

Completed

Estimated Study Time
How many minutes/hours the student expects a task to require.

Actual Study Time (optional, future enhancement)
How long they actually spent.

5. Functional Requirements
5.1 Subject Management

FR-1: The system shall allow the user to create a new subject with:

Subject name (required)

Optional description

FR-2: The system shall allow the user to view a list of all subjects.

FR-3: The system shall allow the user to delete a subject.

If a subject is deleted, the system must define what happens to its tasks (e.g., delete them too).

FR-4: The system may allow editing subject details (name/description).

5.2 Task Management

FR-5: The system shall allow the user to create a task and associate it with a subject.
Each task should have:

Title (required)

Description (optional)

Subject (required)

Task Type (e.g., Homework, Quiz, Exam, Project, Reading)

Due Date (required)

Estimated time (in minutes or hours)

Priority (Low/Medium/High)

Status (default: Not started)

FR-6: The system shall allow the user to view tasks:

All tasks

Tasks per subject

FR-7: The system shall allow the user to update a task:

Change title, description, due date, estimated time, priority, status, or type.

FR-8: The system shall allow the user to mark a task as completed.

FR-9: The system shall allow the user to delete a task.

5.3 Task Views & Reports

FR-10: The system shall allow the user to view tasks sorted by due date (soonest first).

FR-11: The system shall allow the user to view tasks filtered by:

Subject

Status (e.g., only incomplete tasks)

Priority

Task Type (optional)

FR-12: The system shall provide a view of tasks due within a time window, e.g.:

Today

Next 3 days

Next 7 days

FR-13: The system may provide a summary per subject, such as:

Number of tasks total

Number of completed tasks

Remaining tasks and nearest due date

5.4 Time & Workload (Optional for v1 but useful to think about)

FR-14 (optional): The system may allow the user to track actual time spent on a task (manual input).

FR-15 (optional): The system may show total estimated study time remaining:

For all tasks

Per subject

Per chosen time window (e.g., this week)

5.5 Data Persistence

FR-16: The system shall save all data (subjects & tasks) to a local file when the user chooses to save or exit.

FR-17: The system shall load existing data on startup (if a data file exists).

FR-18: The data format can initially be:

CSV
OR

A simple text-based format
(Exact format can be decided later.)

5.6 User Interaction (Console Version)

FR-19: The system shall provide a text-based menu with options such as:

Manage Subjects

Manage Tasks

View Reports

Save Data

Exit

FR-20: The system shall provide clear prompts and messages when:

Input is invalid

Operations succeed or fail

FR-21: The system should confirm destructive actions (e.g., deleting subjects/tasks).

6. Non-Functional Requirements
6.1 Usability

The application should be usable by someone with no Java knowledge (just knows how to run it).

Clear, consistent wording in menus and prompts.

6.2 Performance

The app should feel responsive for typical student workloads:

Up to ~1020 subjects

Up to ~200 tasks

(This is easily manageable by Java and ArrayList.)

6.3 Reliability

The system should not crash on invalid user input (e.g., letters where a number is expected).

Data must not be corrupted when saving (e.g., ensure proper handling of file write errors).

6.4 Portability

The app should run on any system that supports Java (Windows, Mac, Linux) with minimal setup.

7. Constraints & Assumptions

The project will be written in Java (version chosen based on her class, e.g., Java 17).

No external database; only local file storage.

No network or online services required.

User runs the app from terminal/command prompt or via IDE.

8. Future Enhancements (Not Required for v1, Just for Thinking)

These are nice-to-have ideas she can keep in mind but not implement right away:

GUI with JavaFX:

Separate windows/tabs for subjects, tasks, and summaries.

Calendar-style view:

Monthly view with tasks on dates.

Integration with:

Google Calendar (export tasks)

CSV export/import

Analytics:

Charts of time spent vs estimated

Distribution of work across subjects

Smart recommendations:

Suggest what to work on next based on priority, due date, and estimated effort.

9. User Stories (To Help Her Think in Scenarios)

These are human-language requirements to guide her thinking:

As a student, I want to add my courses so I can organize tasks by subject.

As a student, I want to add tasks with due dates and priorities so I dont forget important work.

As a student, I want to see everything due this week so I can plan my time.

As a student, I want to mark tasks as complete so I can track my progress.

As a student, I want to save my tasks and load them next time so I dont have to re-enter everything.

As a student, I want to filter tasks by subject or status so I can focus on one course at a time.

(Optional) As a student, I want to compare estimated vs actual time so I can improve my planning.

This is a solid requirements-only view: what the system should do and support, without deciding how exactly.

If youd like, your next step could be:

Highlight which requirements are must-have for v1 vs later

Turn 57 of these into a first 4-week milestone list she can realistically hit

And only after that, we can talk about:

Class breakdown

Data structures

Flow of the menu / program design.
